PHP code goes in the current theme's functions.php file

To enforce the default quantity on a specific product field, click on 'Advanced' tab of the field, check the option 'Allow field to be populated dynamically' and add 'default_quantity' in the input labelled 'Quantity'. 

This method is usually useful if you want to hide the product field with 'gf_invisible' css class but still want to assign a specific quantity to the product field. This is also useful if you want the product quantity input box to be prefilled with a default value.
